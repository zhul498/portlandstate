Explain how your algorithm works for this problem. 

Where do we see interval halving at work here?
We can see interval halving at

What is the best-case scenario? 
O(1), where the list is already sorted so we can just return the first element of the array.

What is the worst-case scenario? 
O(logn), where the minimum is at the far right. In that case we have to halve our scope logn many times. 

Could this be done using Linear Search?
Yes, this can be done using Linear Search by setting the minimum value to the first element in the array. After checking one by one whether or not current minimum
is greater than the current one we are looking at, we can update our new minimum value.
